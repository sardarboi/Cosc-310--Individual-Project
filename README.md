# Cosc-310--Individual-Project
This project is done by Harsimar Singh for the course COSC 310

This is a project to create a chatbot for the course COSC310. I have created a new project rather than continuing the teamwork after getting permission from the professor. It was stated that the Grade of the assignment would solely depend on the new features that should have been added to the project which are done in this new one.
I have coded the project in Python which is a modern object-oriented language. My project uses Waifu API for the chatbot. The conversation is taking place between a student and the teacher in which the AI can be the teacher or the student depending upon the state of the conversation.
